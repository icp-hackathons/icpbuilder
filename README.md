# ICP Builder

## Components of ICPB App

- State: A persistent storage for storing data.
- Actions: Basically functions. They make your app functional.

## Philosophy

The goal of ICP Builder is for web2 and web3 novice users to be able to build no-code apps without extra effort and no technical knowledge of the underlying software itself. With ICP Builder, users should be able to build applications as simple as a todo application or as complex as a twitter clone.

## Solution

There will be two modes - Basic and Advanced. Basic will be simple and very basic. The user does not have to worry about any data types or other low-level details in Basic mode. In Advanced mode, the user has a lot more choices and customizability. In Basic mode, for each `Object`, a `State` is automatically created underneath the hood, however, in Advanced mode, you can customize the details of the `State`.
